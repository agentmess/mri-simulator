![90-pulse on and off resonance](https://github.com/markus-nilsson/mri-simulator/blob/main/gif/mridemo_90pulse.gif "90 pulse on and off resonance")

Figure 1: Illustration of the effect of a 90 pulse that is either on resonance or off resonance. In the on-resonance condition, the magnetic field making up the 90&deg; pulse (shown by a black arrow) rotates with the same frequency as the magnetization. In the off-resonance condition, the magnetization rotates faster than the 90&deg; pulse. This results in a slight tilt of the magnetization, but far from the 90&deg; flip in the on-resonance condition.
