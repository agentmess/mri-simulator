# 90&deg; pulse in the on-resonance and off-resonance conditions

![90 pulse](../gif/mridemo_90pulse.gif)

Figure 1: Illustration of the effect of a 90째 pulse that is either on resonance or off resonance. In the 
on-resonance condition, the magnetic field making up the 90째 pulse (shown by a black arrow) rotates with 
the same frequency as the magnetization. In the off-resonance condition, the magnetization rotates faster 
than the 90째 pulse. This results in a slight tilt of the magnetization, but far from the 90째 flip in the 
on-resonance condition.
